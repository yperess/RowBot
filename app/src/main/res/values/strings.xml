We encourage rowers of all ages, genders, skill levels, and boat types to use this application while exercising. Data collected during the use will be sent to the developers for analysis (over WiFi only to avoid using your data plan). This analysis will be used to generate new algorithms that will provide you, the user, with better and more accurate rowing analysis.</p><p>The data we collect:<br/>&bull; Accelerometer Sensor Data<br/>&bull; Gyroscope Sensor Data<br/>&bull; Gravity Sensor Data<br/>The data gathered can be sent completely anonymously. While anonymity is guaranteed to always be an option, some additional data does help us provide you with better analysis.
